I watched this movie for the first time this year (2019) and now I am regretting myself because I don't watched earlier. How could I lived all this time without knowing this beatifull story, this masterpiece?

Today I can afirm that Blade Runner is one of the best movies of all time. It's a must watch movie for everyone. Why this movie is so good? I explain, but i think it's better you watch firts and come here later to read this:

1. Ambientation: The movie only tell you a brif introduction af what happened to earth in this distopic future. All the rest you can deduct by feeling the scenario atmosphere. The cyberpunk-noir scenario is breathtaking. You feel the impact off superpopulation, the culture miscigenation that shufling dialets, the always dark sky, the depressive air crossing the streets. When the movie dont explain what led the earth to this situation, we start to conjecture what happened, and this is very awesome. All the ambientation creates a perfect mystery atmosphere.

I really like this movie because it show you only a tiny part off a whole new and distinct universe. But, at the same moment, it possibilities you to infer and imagine all the lore behind this universe.

2. Philosophy: The movie holds a very philosophic script. What we define as humans? The movie talks about biologic humanoid creatures crafted to be slaves of humankind and their feelings. Talks about the meaning and purpose of life. One of the most iconic scenes is exactly about this, the "tears in the rain".

3. Dialogs: All the dialogs are very deep and well constructed. The phrases are very poetics and needs to be interpreted. In a firts view some scenes maybe look confusing. But thats because you need to take attention at the philosofy and details of the movie.

4. History: Ahh! The history! It's better you whatch. The goodness of this history is self explanatory.

That's almost it. If i write too much no one will read this. Thanks for the attention and sorry if i committed any english misspelling.
