The treatment threshold is the probability above which the diagnosis is so likely you would treat the patient without further testing. The test threshold is the probability below which the diagnosis is so unlikely it is excluded without further testing (Figure 1-2).




Diagnostic tests are necessary when the pretest probability of disease is in the middle, above the test threshold and below the treatment threshold. A really useful test shifts the probability of disease so much that the posttest probability (the probability of disease after the test is done) crosses one of the thresholds (Figure 1-5).
