5.0/5 - I consider it one of my favorite films of all time

4.5/5 - A truly great film that I probably love, but there are just some things keeping it from being one of my absolute favorites

4.0/5 - A good film that I would recommend to anyone, but not really close to being one of my absolute favorites

3.5/5 - A perfectly fine film that I like, but it would only be a specialized recommendation to someone who might also enjoy the same stuff, rather than a recommendation to anyone

3.0/5 - A film I enjoy but I wouldn't say anyone needs to go out of their way to see it

2.5/5 - A film that's okay but really close to being bad, and I wouldn't say there's really any reason for someone to watch it

2.0/5 - This is where I start defining films as bad. These are just barely bad, though: fun to watch, but ridiculous, or stupid, or just poorly made

1.5/5 - These films are clearly bad, but with some redeeming qualities that prevent them from being complete trash

1.0/5 - These films are the worst of the worst, but there's something keeping me from truly loathing them, like they're funny, or charming, or fun, or interesting

0.5/5 - I consider it one of my least favorite films of all time. It's either made horribly with no redeeming qualities, or it takes a position on a topic that I find irredeemable, or it is just so stupid that it makes my brain hurt, or it is supremely boring. The kind of film where I'm just in disbelief the whole time about how bad it is


Here’s how I rate mine:

10- Masterpiece; No Flaws, Rewatchable & Would Buy

9- Fantastic; Little Flaws, Rewatchable & Would Buy

8- Great; Some Flaws, Rewatchable & Maybe Buy

7- Good; Some Flaws, Might Rewatch While Channel Surfing

6- Okay; Forgettable; Wouldn’t Rewatch or Buy

5- Meh; Forgettable

4- More Bad Than Good; Forgettable

3- Boring; Some Major Flaws

2- It’s Bad; Major Flaws All Around

1- Barely a Movie; Almost Nothing Redeemable

0- Absolute Trash
