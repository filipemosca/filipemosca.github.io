## Críticas à MBE

#### What kind of evidence is it that Evidence-Based Medicine advocates want health care providers and consumers to pay attention to?

Haynes, R.B. What kind of evidence is it that Evidence-Based Medicine advocates want health care providers and consumers to pay attention to?. BMC Health Serv Res 2, 3 (2002). https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-2-3.

Segundo KARL: 

> "Uma das coisas mais legais sobre MBE que já vi é que ela MESMA, a medicina baseada em EVIDÊNCIAS, NÃO É baseada em evidências hehe. O próprio Brian Haynes, epidemiologista da McMaster, berço da MBE, reconheceu isso.. Mas tá valendo"

Lendo o artigo:

> The challenges in applying new knowledge, however, are considerable, and EBM does not address them all. Two that EBM tries to address are as follows. **First**, the advance of knowledge is incremental, with many false steps, and with breakthroughs few and far between, so that only a very tiny fraction of the reports in the medical literature signal new knowledge that is both adequately tested and important enough for practitioners to depend upon and apply. **Second**, practitioners have limited time and little understanding of research methods.
