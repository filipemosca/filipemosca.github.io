Hi, folks! Now I will start to write in English because I want to improve my fluency. I don't master the grammar yet so this English posts probably will have a lot off errors. But I think this is the best way for me to practice and learn. It's by doing mistakes that we learn.

For now I am re-studing English grammar with the book "English grammar in use" and with the "BBC Learning English Course". My goal is to become confident enough in English at the end of this year.

Probably I will write more about my progress in English here and also in other languages that I want to learn soon (like Spanish, German, Esperanto, Ancient Greek, etc.)

Sorry for the possible mistakes I commited in this post. I see you in the next article.
